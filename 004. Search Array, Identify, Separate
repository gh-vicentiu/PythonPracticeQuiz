#You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:
#The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
#Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
#The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
#Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
#Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.
